# Drums and Drummers
### Simple game for nerds drummers
Still a work in progress.
You can fork it and tune it easy for guitar players for exemple or whatever you want. (Why not b00bs ?!)
## Purpose
 * 30 pictures of drums
 * For each, associate their drummer from 3 drummers.
 * Game Over if you miss, level reached displayed, and the drummer you missed insults you.

## TODO
 * A "jocker" button
 * Do not display a drum twice
 * May add a music category selection.
